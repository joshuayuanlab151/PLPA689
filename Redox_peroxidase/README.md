### Week3 assignment files
I need your help to BLAST these sequences against Uniprot. I split them into six fasta files, and each of you will take one file and run BLAST+ on HPRC. 
* `Class2Prx.fasta` - Xiaohan, 79 sequences
* `Class3Prx. fasta` - Zhilin, 50 sequences
* `DyPA.fasta` - Cooper, 26 sequences
* `DyPB.fasta` - Cheng, 49 sequences
* `DyPC.fasta` - Kainan, 24 sequences
* `DyPD.fasta` - Bin Long, 138 sequences

Let me know if you have questions.
