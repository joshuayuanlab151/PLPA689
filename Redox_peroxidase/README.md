### Week3 assignment files
I need your help to BLAST these sequences against Uniprot. I split them into six fasta files, and each of you will take one file and run BLAST+ on HPRC. 
* `Class2Prx.fasta` - Bin Long
* `Class3Prx. fasta` - Xiaohan
* `DyPA.fasta` - Cooper
* `DyPB.fasta` - Cheng
* `DyPC.fasta` - Kainan
* `DyPD.fasta` - Zhilin

Let me know if you have questions.
